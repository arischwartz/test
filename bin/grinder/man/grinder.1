.SH "NAME"
grinder \- A versatile omics shotgun and amplicon sequencing read simulator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Grinder is a versatile program to create random shotgun and amplicon sequence
libraries based on \s-1DNA\s0, \s-1RNA\s0 or proteic reference sequences provided in a \s-1FASTA\s0
file.
.PP
Grinder can produce genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic, metatranscriptomic,
proteomic, metaproteomic shotgun and amplicon datasets from current sequencing
technologies such as Sanger, 454, Illumina. These simulated datasets can be used
to test the accuracy of bioinformatic tools under specific hypothesis, e.g. with
or without sequencing errors, or with low or high community diversity. Grinder
may also be used to help decide between alternative sequencing methods for a
sequence-based project, e.g. should the library be paired-end or not, how many
reads should be sequenced.
.PP
Grinder features include:
.IP "\(bu" 4
shotgun or amplicon read libraries
.IP "\(bu" 4
omics support to generate genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic,
metagenomic, metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic datasets
.IP "\(bu" 4
arbitrary read length distribution and number of reads
.IP "\(bu" 4
simulation of \s-1PCR\s0 and sequencing errors (chimeras, point mutations, homopolymers)
.IP "\(bu" 4
support for paired-end (mate pair) datasets
.IP "\(bu" 4
specific rank-abundance settings or manually given abundance for each genome, gene or protein
.IP "\(bu" 4
creation of datasets with a given richness (alpha diversity)
.IP "\(bu" 4
independent datasets can share a variable number of genomes (beta diversity)
.IP "\(bu" 4
modeling of the bias created by varying genome lengths or gene copy number
.IP "\(bu" 4
profile mechanism to store preferred options
.IP "\(bu" 4
available to biologists or power users through multiple interfaces: \s-1GUI\s0, \s-1CLI\s0 and \s-1API\s0
.PP
Briefly, given a \s-1FASTA\s0 file containing reference sequence (genomes, genes,
transcripts or proteins), Grinder performs the following steps:
.IP "1." 4
Read the reference sequences, and for amplicon datasets, extracts full-length
reference \s-1PCR\s0 amplicons using the provided degenerate \s-1PCR\s0 primers.
.IP "2." 4
Determine the community structure based on the provided alpha diversity (number
of reference sequences in the library), beta diversity (number of reference
sequences in common between several independent libraries) and specified rank\-
abundance model.
.IP "3." 4
Take shotgun reads from the reference sequences or amplicon reads from the full\-
length reference \s-1PCR\s0 amplicons. The reads may be paired-end reads when an insert
size distribution is specified. The length of the reads depends on the provided
read length distribution and their abundance depends on the relative abundance
in the community structure. Genome length may also biases the number of reads to
take for shotgun datasets at this step. Similarly, for amplicon datasets, the
number of copies of the target gene in the reference genomes may bias the number
of reads to take.
.IP "4." 4
Alter reads by inserting sequencing errors (indels, substitutions and homopolymer
errors) following a position-specific model to simulate reads created by current
sequencing technologies (Sanger, 454, Illumina). Write the reads and their
quality scores in \s-1FASTA\s0, \s-1QUAL\s0 and \s-1FASTQ\s0 files.

To install Grinder globally on your system, run the following commands in a
terminal or command prompt:
.PP
On Linux, Unix, MacOS:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   perl Makefile.PL
\&   make
.Ve
.PP
And finally, with administrator privileges:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   make install
.Ve
.PP
On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake instead of make.
.SS "No administrator privileges?"
.IX Subsection "No administrator privileges?"
If you do not have administrator privileges, Grinder needs to be installed in
your home directory.
.PP
First, follow the instructions to install local::lib
at http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local\-lib\-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique <http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique>. After local::lib is installed, every Perl
module that you install manually or through the \s-1CPAN\s0 command-line application
will be installed in your home directory.
.PP
Then, install Grinder by following the instructions detailed in the \*(L"Procedure\*(R"
section.
.SH "RUNNING GRINDER"
.IX Header "RUNNING GRINDER"
After installation, you can run Grinder using a command-line interface (\s-1CLI\s0), 
an application programming interface (\s-1API\s0) or a graphical user interface (\s-1GUI\s0)
in Galaxy.
.PP
To get the usage of the \s-1CLI\s0, type:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  grinder \-\-help
.Ve
.PP
More information, including the documentation of the Grinder \s-1API\s0, which allows
you to run Grinder from within other Perl programs, is available by typing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perldoc Grinder
.Ve
.PP
To run the \s-1GUI\s0, refer to the Galaxy documentation at <http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/FrontPage>.
.PP
The 'utils' folder included in the Grinder package contains some utilities:
.IP "average genome size:" 4
.IX Item "average genome size:"
This calculates the average genome size (in bp) of a simulated random library
produced by Grinder.
.IP "change_paired_read_orientation:" 4
.IX Item "change_paired_read_orientation:"
This reverses the orientation of each second mate-pair read (\s-1ID\s0 ending in /2)
in a \s-1FASTA\s0 file.
.SH "REFERENCE SEQUENCE DATABASE"
.IX Header "REFERENCE SEQUENCE DATABASE"
A variety of \s-1FASTA\s0 databases can be used as input for Grinder. For example, the
GreenGenes database (<http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Sequence_Data/Fasta_data_files/Isolated_named_strains_16S_aligned.fasta>)
contains over 180,000 16S rRNA clone sequences from various species which would
be appropriate to produce a 16S rRNA amplicon dataset. A set of over 41,000 \s-1OTU\s0
representative sequences and their affiliation in seven different taxonomic
sytems can also be used for the same purpose (<http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/OTUs/gg_otus_6oct2010/rep_set/gg_97_otus_6oct2010.fasta>
and <http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/OTUs/gg_otus_6oct2010/taxonomies/>). The
\&\s-1RDP\s0 (<http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/download/release10_27_unaligned.fa.gz>) and Silva
(http://www.arb\-silva.de/no_cache/download/archive/release_108/Exports/ <http://www.arb-silva.de/no_cache/download/archive/release_108/Exports/>)
databases also provide many 16S rRNA sequences and Silva includes eukaryotic
sequences. While 16S rRNA is a popular gene, datasets containing any type of gene
could be used in the same fashion to generate simulated amplicon datasets, provided
appropriate primers are used.
.PP
The >2,400 curated microbial genome sequences in the \s-1NCBI\s0 RefSeq collection
(<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/microbial/>) would also be suitable for
producing 16S rRNA simulated datasets (using the adequate primers). However, the
lower diversity of this database compared to the previous two makes it more
appropriate for producing artificial microbial metagenomes. Individual genomes
from this database are also very suitable for the simulation of single or
double-barreled shotgun libraries. Similarly, the RefSeq database contains
over 3,100 curated viral sequences (<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/>)
which can be used to produce artificial viral metagenomes.
.PP
Quite a few eukaryotic organisms have been sequenced and their genome or genes
can be the basis for simulating genomic, transcriptomic (RNA-seq) or proteomic 
datasets. For example, you can use the human genome available at
<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/>, the human transcripts
downloadable from <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.rna.fna.gz>
or the human proteome at <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.protein.faa.gz>.

.IP "\-id <insert_dist>... | \-insert_dist <insert_dist>..." 4
.IX Item "-id <insert_dist>... | -insert_dist <insert_dist>..."
Create paired-end or mate-pair reads spanning the given insert length.
Important: the insert is defined in the biological sense, i.e. its length includes
the length of both reads and of the stretch of \s-1DNA\s0 between them:
   0 : off,
   or: insert size distribution in bp, in the same format as the read length
       distribution (a typical value is 2,500 bp for mate pairs)
Two distinct reads are generated whether or not the mate pair overlaps. Default:
0
.IP "\-mo <mate_orientation> | \-mate_orientation <mate_orientation>" 4
.IX Item "-mo <mate_orientation> | -mate_orientation <mate_orientation>"
When generating paired-end or mate-pair reads (see <insert_dist>), specify the
orientation of the reads (F: forward, R: reverse):
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   FR:  \-\-\-> <\-\-\-  e.g. Sanger, Illumina paired\-end, IonTorrent mate\-pair
\&   FF:  \-\-\-> \-\-\->  e.g. 454

.Sp
Default: \s-1FR\s0
.IP "\-ec <exclude_chars> | \-exclude_chars <exclude_chars>" 4
.IX Item "-ec <exclude_chars> | -exclude_chars <exclude_chars>"
Do not create reads containing any of the specified characters (case insensitive).
For example, use '\s-1NX\s0' to prevent reads with ambiguities (N or X). Grinder will
error if it fails to find a suitable read (or pair of reads) after 10 attempts.
Consider using <delete_chars>, which may be more appropriate for your case.
Default: ''
.IP "\-dc <delete_chars> | \-delete_chars <delete_chars>" 4
.IX Item "-dc <delete_chars> | -delete_chars <delete_chars>"
Remove the specified characters from the reference sequences (case-insensitive),
e.g. '\-~*' to remove gaps (\- or ~) or terminator (*). Removing these characters
is done once, when reading the reference sequences, prior to taking reads. Hence
it is more efficient than <exclude_chars>. Default:
.IP "\-fr <forward_reverse> | \-forward_reverse <forward_reverse>" 4
.IX Item "-fr <forward_reverse> | -forward_reverse <forward_reverse>"
Use \s-1DNA\s0 amplicon sequencing using a forward and reverse \s-1PCR\s0 primer sequence
provided in a \s-1FASTA\s0 file. The reference sequences and their reverse complement
will be searched for \s-1PCR\s0 primer matches. The primer sequences should use the
\&\s-1IUPAC\s0 convention for degenerate residues and the reference sequences that that
do not match the specified primers are excluded. If your reference sequences are
full genomes, it is recommended to use <copy_bias> = 1 and <length_bias> = 0 to
generate amplicon reads. To sequence from the forward strand, set <unidirectional>
to 1 and put the forward primer first and reverse primer second in the \s-1FASTA\s0
file. To sequence from the reverse strand, invert the primers in the \s-1FASTA\s0 file
and use <unidirectional> = \-1. The second primer sequence in the \s-1FASTA\s0 file is
always optional. Example: \s-1AAACTYAAAKGAATTGRCGG\s0 and \s-1ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC\s0 for the 926F
and 1392R primers that target the V6 to V9 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
.IP "\-un <unidirectional> | \-unidirectional <unidirectional>" 4
.IX Item "-un <unidirectional> | -unidirectional <unidirectional>"
Instead of producing reads bidirectionally, from the reference strand and its
reverse complement, proceed unidirectionally, from one strand only (forward or
reverse). Values: 0 (off, i.e. bidirectional), 1 (forward), \-1 (reverse). Use
<unidirectional> = 1 for amplicon and strand-specific transcriptomic or
proteomic datasets. Default: 0
.IP "\-lb <length_bias> | \-length_bias <length_bias>" 4
.IX Item "-lb <length_bias> | -length_bias <length_bias>"
In shotgun libraries, sample reference sequences proportionally to their length.
For example, in simulated microbial datasets, this means that at the same
relative abundance, larger genomes contribute more reads than smaller genomes
(and all genomes have the same fold coverage).
0 = no, 1 = yes. Default: 1
.IP "\-cb <copy_bias> | \-copy_bias <copy_bias>" 4
.IX Item "-cb <copy_bias> | -copy_bias <copy_bias>"
In amplicon libraries where full genomes are used as input, sample species
proportionally to the number of copies of the target gene: at equal relative
abundance, genomes that have multiple copies of the target gene contribute more
amplicon reads than genomes that have a single copy. 0 = no, 1 = yes. Default:
1
.IP "\-md <mutation_dist>... | \-mutation_dist <mutation_dist>..." 4
.IX Item "-md <mutation_dist>... | -mutation_dist <mutation_dist>..."
Introduce sequencing errors in the reads, under the form of mutations
(substitutions, insertions and deletions) at positions that follow a specified
distribution (with replacement): model (uniform, linear, poly4), model parameters.
For example, for a uniform 0.1% error rate, use: uniform 0.1. To simulate Sanger
errors, use a linear model where the errror rate is 1% at the 5' end of reads and
2% at the 3' end: linear 1 2. To model Illumina errors using the 4th degree
polynome 3e\-3 + 3.3e\-8 * i^4 (Korbel et al 2009), use: poly4 3e\-3 3.3e\-8.
Use the <mutation_ratio> option to alter how many of these mutations are
substitutions or indels. Default: uniform 0 0
.IP "\-mr <mutation_ratio>... | \-mutation_ratio <mutation_ratio>..." 4
.IX Item "-mr <mutation_ratio>... | -mutation_ratio <mutation_ratio>..."
Indicate the percentage of substitutions and the number of indels (insertions
and deletions). For example, use '80 20' (4 substitutions for each indel) for
Sanger reads. Note that this parameter has no effect unless you specify the
<mutation_dist> option. Default: 80 20
.IP "\-hd <homopolymer_dist> | \-homopolymer_dist <homopolymer_dist>" 4
.IX Item "-hd <homopolymer_dist> | -homopolymer_dist <homopolymer_dist>"
Introduce sequencing errors in the reads under the form of homopolymeric
stretches (e.g. \s-1AAA\s0, \s-1CCCCC\s0) using a specified model where the homopolymer length
follows a normal distribution N(mean, standard deviation) that is function of
the homopolymer length n:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  Margulies: N(n, 0.15 * n)              ,  Margulies et al. 2005.
\&  Richter  : N(n, 0.15 * sqrt(n))        ,  Richter et al. 2008.
\&  Balzer   : N(n, 0.03494 + n * 0.06856) ,  Balzer et al. 2010.
.Ve
.Sp
Default: 0
.IP "\-cp <chimera_perc> | \-chimera_perc <chimera_perc>" 4
.IX Item "-cp <chimera_perc> | -chimera_perc <chimera_perc>"
Specify the percent of reads in amplicon libraries that should be chimeric
sequences. The 'reference' field in the description of chimeric reads will
contain the \s-1ID\s0 of all the reference sequences forming the chimeric template.
A typical value is 10% for amplicons. This option can be used to generate
chimeric shotgun reads as well. Default: 0 %
.IP "\-cd <chimera_dist>... | \-chimera_dist <chimera_dist>..." 4
.IX Item "-cd <chimera_dist>... | -chimera_dist <chimera_dist>..."
Specify the distribution of chimeras: bimeras, trimeras, quadrameras and
multimeras of higher order. The default is the average values from Quince et al.
2011: '314 38 1', which corresponds to 89% of bimeras, 11% of trimeras and 0.3%
of quadrameras. Note that this option only takes effect when you request the
generation of chimeras with the <chimera_perc> option. Default: 314 38 1
.IP "\-ck <chimera_kmer> | \-chimera_kmer <chimera_kmer>" 4
.IX Item "-ck <chimera_kmer> | -chimera_kmer <chimera_kmer>"
Activate a method to form chimeras by picking breakpoints at places where k\-mers
are shared between sequences. <chimera_kmer> represents k, the length of the
k\-mers (in bp). The longer the kmer, the more similar the sequences have to be
to be eligible to form chimeras. The more frequent a k\-mer is in the pool of
reference sequences (taking into account their relative abundance), the more
often this k\-mer will be chosen. For example, \s-1CHSIM\s0 (Edgar et al. 2011) uses this
method with a k\-mer length of 10 bp. If you do not want to use k\-mer information
to form chimeras, use 0, which will result in the reference sequences and
breakpoints to be taken randomly on the \*(L"aligned\*(R" reference sequences. Note that
this option only takes effect when you request the generation of chimeras with
the <chimera_perc> option. Also, this options is quite memory intensive, so you
should probably limit yourself to a relatively small number of reference sequences
if you want to use it. Default: 10 bp
.IP "\-af <abundance_file> | \-abundance_file <abundance_file>" 4
.IX Item "-af <abundance_file> | -abundance_file <abundance_file>"
Specify the relative abundance of the reference sequences manually in an input
file. Each line of the file should contain a sequence name and its relative
abundance (%), e.g. 'seqABC 82.1' or 'seqABC 82.1 10.2' if you are specifying two
different libraries.
.IP "\-am <abundance_model>... | \-abundance_model <abundance_model>..." 4
.IX Item "-am <abundance_model>... | -abundance_model <abundance_model>..."
Relative abundance model for the input reference sequences: uniform, linear, powerlaw,
logarithmic or exponential. The uniform and linear models do not require a
parameter, but the other models take a parameter in the range [0, infinity). If
this parameter is not specified, then it is randomly chosen. Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  uniform distribution: uniform
\&  powerlaw distribution with parameter 0.1: powerlaw 0.1
\&  exponential distribution with automatically chosen parameter: exponential
.Ve
.Sp
Default: uniform 1
.IP "\-nl <num_libraries> | \-num_libraries <num_libraries>" 4
.IX Item "-nl <num_libraries> | -num_libraries <num_libraries>"
Number of independent libraries to create. Specify how diverse and similar they
should be with <diversity>, <shared_perc> and <permuted_perc>. Assign them
different \s-1MID\s0 tags with <multiplex_mids>. Default: 1
.IP "\-mi <multiplex_ids> | \-multiplex_ids <multiplex_ids>" 4
.IX Item "-mi <multiplex_ids> | -multiplex_ids <multiplex_ids>"
Specify an optional \s-1FASTA\s0 file that contains multiplex sequence identifiers
(a.k.a MIDs or barcodes) to add to the sequences (one sequence per library). The
MIDs are included in the length specified with the \-read_dist option and can be
altered by sequencing errors. See the MIDesigner or BarCrawl programs to
generate \s-1MID\s0 sequences.
.IP "\-di <diversity>... | \-diversity <diversity>..." 4
.IX Item "-di <diversity>... | -diversity <diversity>..."
This option specifies alpha diversity, specifically the richness, i.e. number of
reference sequences to take randomly and include in each library. Use 0 for the
maximum richness possible (based on the number of reference sequences available).
Provide one value to make all libraries have the same diversity, or one richness
value per library otherwise. Default: 0
.IP "\-sp <shared_perc> | \-shared_perc <shared_perc>" 4
.IX Item "-sp <shared_perc> | -shared_perc <shared_perc>"
This option controls an aspect of beta-diversity. When creating multiple
libraries, specify the percent of reference sequences they should have in common
(relative to the diversity of the least diverse library). Default: 0 %
.IP "\-pp <permuted_perc> | \-permuted_perc <permuted_perc>" 4
.IX Item "-pp <permuted_perc> | -permuted_perc <permuted_perc>"
This option controls another aspect of beta-diversity. For multiple libraries,
choose the percent of the most-abundant reference sequences to permute (randomly
shuffle) the rank-abundance of. Default: 0 %
.IP "\-rs <random_seed> | \-random_seed <random_seed>" 4
.IX Item "-rs <random_seed> | -random_seed <random_seed>"
Seed number to use for the pseudo-random number generator.
.IP "\-dt <desc_track> | \-desc_track <desc_track>" 4
.IX Item "-dt <desc_track> | -desc_track <desc_track>"
Track read information (reference sequence, position, errors, ...) by writing
it in the read description. Default: 1
.IP "\-ql <qual_levels>... | \-qual_levels <qual_levels>..." 4
.IX Item "-ql <qual_levels>... | -qual_levels <qual_levels>..."
Generate basic quality scores for the simulated reads. Good residues are given a
specified good score (e.g. 30) and residues that are the result of an insertion
or substitution are given a specified bad score (e.g. 10). Specify first the
good score and then the bad score on the command-line, e.g.: 30 10. Default:
.IP "\-fq <fastq_output> | \-fastq_output <fastq_output>" 4
.IX Item "-fq <fastq_output> | -fastq_output <fastq_output>"
Whether to write the generated reads in \s-1FASTQ\s0 format (with Sanger-encoded
quality scores) instead of \s-1FASTA\s0 and \s-1QUAL\s0 or not (1: yes, 0: no).
<qual_levels> need to be specified for this option to be effective. Default: 0
.IP "\-bn <base_name> | \-base_name <base_name>" 4
.IX Item "-bn <base_name> | -base_name <base_name>"
Prefix of the output files. Default: grinder
.IP "\-od <output_dir> | \-output_dir <output_dir>" 4
.IX Item "-od <output_dir> | -output_dir <output_dir>"
Directory where the results should be written. This folder will be created if
needed. Default: .
.IP "\-pf <profile_file> | \-profile_file <profile_file>" 4
.IX Item "-pf <profile_file> | -profile_file <profile_file>"
A file that contains Grinder arguments. This is useful if you use many options
or often use the same options. Lines with comments (#) are ignored. Consider the
profile file, 'simple_profile.txt':
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  # A simple Grinder profile
\&  \-read_dist 105 normal 12
\&  \-total_reads 1000
.Ve
.Sp
Running: grinder \-reference_file viral_genomes.fa \-profile_file simple_profile.txt
.Sp
Translates into: grinder \-reference_file viral_genomes.fa \-read_dist 105 normal 12 \-total_reads 1000
.Sp
Note that the arguments specified in the profile should not be specified again on the command line.
.SH "CLI OUTPUT"
.IX Header "CLI OUTPUT"
For each shotgun or amplicon read library requested, the following files are
generated:
.IP "\(bu" 4
A rank-abundance file, tab-delimited, that shows the relative abundance of the
different reference sequences
.IP "\(bu" 4
A file containing the read sequences in \s-1FASTA\s0 format. The read headers
contain information necessary to track from which reference sequence each read
was taken and what errors it contains. This file is not generated if <fastq_output>
option was provided.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the <qual_levels> option was specified, a file containing the quality scores
of the reads (in \s-1QUAL\s0 format).
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the <fastq_output> option was provided, a file containing the read sequences
in \s-1FASTQ\s0 format.
